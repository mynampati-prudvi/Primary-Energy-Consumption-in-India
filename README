The primary energy consumption in India is the third biggest after China and USA with 5.6% global share in 2017. The energy policy of India is largely defined by the country's expanding energy deficit and increased focus on developing alternative sources of energy, particularly nuclear, solar and wind energy. India ranks 81 position in overall energy self-sufficiency at 66% in 2017.

India's energy crisis is set to deepen as top producers of coal, natural gas and oil recently said their output will grow little in the next few of years – not what the country wants to hear at a time when its thirst for fuel shows no sign of abating. This means more fuel imports and costlier import bills at energy companies. It also means India's energy sector is becoming increasingly vulnerable to global supply disruptions and price volatility due to events like Australia's floods and unrest in the Middle East.

Congratulations, you have been retained by an alternative investment firm to manage a private-public partnership with the Indian government and lead a team to understand the effect of the energy deficit on the economy and citizenry, and design a data-driven story to transition India to  alternative sources of energy, namely renewables. The ministry of power and senior leaders in the Indian Government are split as whether renewables can be a sustainable source of energy and if it could fill the energy deficit. It is now up to you to formulate a business problem (plan of action) on how to tackle this issue. The ultimate deliverable will be to deliver business intelligence insights and visualizations (class 6) that will be delivered to the ministry of power and various governmental departments (PM’s office, ministry of agriculture, Ministry of Environment & Forests (MoEF), Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Ministry of Mines) to use to inform their decisions.
